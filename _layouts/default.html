      Hi ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to The Modern's homepage. We're a couple of friends talking into microphones. We've recapped
      our favorite TV shows, interviewed interesting people, and shared our thoughts about world events. I hope
      you find something for you.

      If you're curious how we built this site, we have good news! It's open source! Take a look at
      the site on Github here: https://github.com/smeriwether/themodern.fm.

      Enjoy the rest of your ${weekdays[today.getDay()]}.
