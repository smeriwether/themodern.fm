He then left the small town with big-city dreams just outside of Houston. He spent a few years there until he met his eventual wife. This led him to be a girl dad to 3 incredible young girls at such a young age. He made the commitment and moved to Oklahoma City in 2008, and he has been here ever since. After a decade of marriage, covid came. He thought he was changing careers and inevitably leaving Oklahoma, but the pandemic changed that. He was lucky enough to stay at his job for a few months longer than&nbsp;expected, but after that, he was unsure of his future.
