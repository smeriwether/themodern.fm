Scott and I met playing volleyball this fall. He talks about his struggles growing up with a father of addiction in the panhandle of West Texas. He did not come from a diverse community, but the village that raised him taught him to love his neighbor regardless of who they are and what they look like. He then left the small town with big-city dreams just outside of Houston. He spent a few years there until he met his eventual wife. This led him to be a girl dad to 3 incredible young girls at such a young age. He made the commitment and moved to Oklahoma City in 2008, and he has been here ever since. After a decade of marriage, covid came. He thought he was changing careers and inevitably leaving Oklahoma, but the pandemic changed that. He was lucky enough to stay at his job for a few months longer than&nbsp;expected, but after that, he was unsure of his future.
